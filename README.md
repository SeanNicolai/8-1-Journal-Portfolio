# Artemis Financial Secure Software Project

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation and artifacts from my project with Artemis Financial, focusing on enhancing the security of their software application. The main artifact is the "Practices for Secure Software Report," which outlines the steps taken to refactor the application, implement secure coding practices, and address identified vulnerabilities.

## Artifact

- **Practices for Secure Software Report**: This document includes a comprehensive analysis and implementation of security measures such as AES encryption, secure certificate generation, secure communications setup, and extensive software testing.

## Reflection

### Artemis Financial and Their Requirements

Artemis Financial, a client in the financial sector, required a thorough security overhaul of their software systems. The primary focus was on securing sensitive financial data and ensuring robust protection against potential cyber threats.

### Key Achievements

- **Identifying Security Vulnerabilities**: Successfully pinpointed critical security flaws in the existing system and developed strategies for their mitigation.
- **Implementing AES Encryption**: Chose and implemented the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data encryption, providing strong security without performance trade-offs.
- **Transitioning to HTTPS**: Upgraded communications from HTTP to HTTPS, ensuring secure data transfer.

### Challenges

The most significant challenge was addressing the 115 vulnerabilities found across 15 dependencies. This required a detailed and prioritized approach for resolution.

### Future Strategies

For future projects, I plan to utilize regular dependency checks, secure coding practices, and automated tools for early detection of vulnerabilities.

### Ensuring Software Functionality and Security

Post-refactoring, I conducted rigorous testing to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced and that the application remained functional and secure.

### Tools and Practices

Throughout this project, I employed various tools and practices that will be invaluable in future assignments, including dependency-check tools, AES for encryption, and HTTPS protocols.

## Skills and Knowledge for Future Employers

This project showcases my ability to:

- Conduct detailed vulnerability assessments.
- Implement and test secure software practices.
- Adapt and respond to emerging security challenges in software development.
